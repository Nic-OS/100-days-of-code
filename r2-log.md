# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - [Nico Salas]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 7, Monday, 2018].

## Log

### R2D1 
Starting a new app. Using Microsoft's Computer Vision API. Really excited to learn new skills for this app since it's very different from what I did in my first app. Reviewed JQuery and JSON/AJAX requests.

### R2D2
Practiced getting JSON data and converting to html. This will be a key feature of the app. Created Microsoft Azure account to use the Computer Vision API. Wrote a draft workplan for the app. I want to try hitting 2 hours of coding per day instead of 1.
