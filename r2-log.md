# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - [Nico Salas]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 7, Monday, 2018].

## Log

### R2D1 
Starting a new app. Using Microsoft's Computer Vision API. Really excited to learn new skills for this app since it's very different from what I did in my first app. Reviewed JQuery and JSON/AJAX requests.

### R2D2
Practiced getting JSON data and converting to html. This will be a key feature of the app. Created Microsoft Azure account to use the Computer Vision API. Wrote a draft workplan for the app. I want to try hitting 2 hours of coding per day instead of 1.

### R2D3
Read through the documentation for the Computer Vision API. Tried going through the tutorial but couldn't get it to analyze an image.

### R2D4
Got the tutorial working. The problem was I didn't choose one of the few options in the API for a valid Subscription Region in my Azure dashboard, so the subscription keys weren't valid for me to use the API. I don't know why Microsoft even allows you to select regions that won't work with the REST API request later anyway.

I was able to have the API analyze my own business card and it extracted the text perfectly, though my next challenge will be to get it to properly classify what it's seeing (e.g., mobile number, fax number, email address, company name, etc.).
